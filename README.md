#Haskell

Good day, everyone! This is a repository where I plan to store my haskell related files as a method of back up. Not sure if anyone would ever be interested in it, but that doesn't matter!

Currently populated by:

1. Files from Introduction to Functional Programming Using Haskell, Second Edition
2. Files from Project Euler that I attemp to solve with Haskell
3. Other miscelaneous files that I play around sometime

Good luck and have fun!
